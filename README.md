# HI - 743: Predictive Analytics in Healthcare

This repository stores my notes and materials from teaching HI 743 at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee during the Spring 2025 semester. This course was taught out of two texts: 

**Introducton to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. 2nd ed.**:
> James, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. 2nd ed., Springer, 2021.

**Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies**
> Kelleher, John D., Brian Mac Namee, and Aoife D'Arcy. Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies. The MIT Press, 2015.

This course met once weekly on Thursdays where myself and 14 students would walk through various machine learning models and their applications to Healthcare data. At the end of each lecture, we would work through an example of the methods being applied to data using **R**. The lecture slides and lab portions are included in each lecture's directory.
